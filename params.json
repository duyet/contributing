That's awesome. However, before\r\ndoing so, please read the following simple steps how to contribute. This will\r\nmake the life easier and will avoid wasting time on things which are not\r\nrequested. :sparkles:\r\n\r\n## Discuss the changes before doing them\r\n - First of all, open an issue in the repository, using the **bug tracker**,\r\n   describing the contribution you would like to make, the bug you found or any\r\n   other ideas you have. This will help us to get you started on the right\r\n   foot.\r\n\r\n - If it makes sense, add the platform and software information (e.g. operating\r\n   system, Node.JS version etc.), screenshots (so we can see what you are\r\n   seeing).\r\n\r\n - It is recommended to wait for feedback before continuing to next steps.\r\n   However, if the issue is clear (e.g. a typo) and the fix is simple, you can\r\n   continue and fix it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Fixing issues\r\n - Fork the project on Github and create a branch with your fix:\r\n   `some-great-feature` or `some-issue-fix`.\r\n\r\n - Commit your changes in that branch, writing the code following the\r\n   [code style][1]. If the project contains tests (generally, the `test`\r\n   directory), you are encouraged to add a test as well. :memo:\r\n\r\n - If the project contains a `package.json` or a `bower.json` file add yourself\r\n   in the `contributors` array (or `authors` in the case of `bower.json`;\r\n   if the array does not exist, create it):\r\n\r\n   ```json\r\n   {\r\n      \"contributors\": [\r\n         \"Your Name <and@email.address> (http://your.website)\"\r\n      ]\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n## Creating a pull request\r\n\r\n - Open a pull request, and reference the initial issue in the pull request\r\n   message (e.g. *fixes #<your-issue-number>*). Write a good description and\r\n   title, so everybody will know what is fixed/improved.\r\n\r\n - If it makes sense, add screenshots, gifs etc., so it is easier to see what\r\n   is going on.\r\n\r\n## Wait for feedback\r\nBefore accepting your contributions, I will review them. You may get feedback\r\nabout what should be fixed in your modified code. If so, just keep committing\r\nin your branch and the pull request will be updated automatically.\r\n\r\n## Everyone is happy!\r\nFinally, your contributions will be merged, and everyone will be happy! :smile:\r\nContributions are more than welcome!\r\n\r\nThanks! :sweat_smile:\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/duyetdev/node-style-guide\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
